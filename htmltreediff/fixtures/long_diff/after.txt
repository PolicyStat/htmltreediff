Release Announcement: Protected Policies and Bulk Override
Last night we successfully updated with a shiny new version. Some of the high notes in this release include:

Managers can now restrict the visibility of policies so that only certain users can view them. I'll be writing more about this feature a little later, but the gist is that you can now do things like restrict sensitive HR policies from being viewable by general staff members. Another nice usage would be to partition off one segment of policies, say your Lab policies, so that only users from the lab see them. This reduces search clutter for the rest of your staff members, who don't care about the lab policies.
Site administrators now have access to Bulk Admin Override, which makes performing sweeping changes a painless endeavor.
We optimized the auto-save functionality to eliminate occasional pauses when your changes get saved. These pauses were too long when working on large documents.

All three of these features were prioritized based on direct customer feedback, and we're excited to be able to make them happen. Once again, I think our customers were right on the money with their suggestions on where things could be improved. Thanks for the feedback as always. If you have any questions/concerns/comments, or if you are just wondering how the weather is in Indianapolis, drop us a line.
