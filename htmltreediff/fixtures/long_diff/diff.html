Release Announcement: Protected Policies and Bulk Override
Last night we successfully updated with a shiny new version. Some of the high notes in this release include:

Managers can now restrict the visibility of <del>certain </del>policies <ins>so </ins>that only certain users can view <del>policies</del><ins>them</ins>. I'll be writing <del>up a bit </del>more about this feature a little later, but the gist is that you can now do things like <del>restricting certain </del><ins>restrict </ins>sensitive HR policies from being viewable by general staff members. Another nice usage would be <del>for partitioning </del><ins>to partition </ins>off one segment of policies, say your Lab policies, so that only users from the lab <del>saw them, which can reduce </del><ins>see them. This reduces </ins>search clutter for the <del>majority </del><ins>rest </ins>of your staff <del>that doesn't</del><ins>members, who don't</ins> care about <del>that set of </del><ins>the lab </ins>policies.
Site administrators now have access to Bulk Admin Override, which makes performing sweeping changes a painless endeavor.
We optimized the auto-save functionality to <del>allow for better editor performance on long, complicated </del><ins>eliminate occasional pauses when your changes get saved. These pauses were too long when working on large </ins>documents.

All three of these features were prioritized based on direct customer feedback<ins>, </ins>and <del>I'm</del><ins>we're</ins> excited <del>we were </del><ins>to be </ins>able to make <del>it </del><ins>them </ins>happen. Once again, I think our customers were right on the money <ins>with their suggestions </ins>on where <del>we could add some very useful functionality</del><ins>things could be improved</ins>. Thanks for the feedback <del>and </del>as always<del>, if </del><ins>. If </ins>you have any <del>other </del>questions/concerns/comments<ins>, </ins>or if you are just wondering how the weather is in Indianapolis, drop us a line.
